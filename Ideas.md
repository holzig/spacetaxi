###Ideas for further extension, modification or refactoring
* Add parameter to supply a different or additional Highway information. e.G.: `taxi --highways=.... path ....` 
* Create a model class representing a system
* Different commands and parameters. Im not quite satisfied with the current solution.
* A more generic support for search
* More possible search criteria
